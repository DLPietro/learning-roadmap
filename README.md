# 🗺️ Learning Roadmap: My Journey in Data & Software Skills

Welcome to my **structured learning roadmap** — a public, week-by-week plan to build and deepen skills in **Python programming, data analysis, and visualization best practices**.

This repository serves as both a **personal study guide** and a **transparent log of progress**, helping me stay consistent, accountable, and focused on measurable goals.
