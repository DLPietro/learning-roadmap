# 🚨 Pietro’s Commit Convention (“Drama Edition”)

> _“I don’t commit code. I commit progress, rage, and occasional victories.”_

I've been trying to use conventional commits; that style, however, soon made me bored. This is how I track my journey to a **data analyst who actually fixes things**.

Adding work, thoughts, and personal drama while coding.

## 💡 How to Use This

When you commit, ask yourself:

> “Am I just writing code… or am I telling a story?”

If it’s **just code**, use `build` or `fix`.  
If it’s **progress**, use `start`, `victory`, or `learn`.  
If it’s **rage**, then **you’re doing it right**.

## ❗ Why This Works

- ✅ **It’s human** — You see the struggle, not just the output.
- ✅ **It’s memorable** — No recruiter forgets a `🤬 rage` commit.
- ✅ **It’s transparent** — Anyone can see your growth, not just your results.
- ✅ **It’s mine** — Not copied from some tech blog. Built by me, for me.

## 📌 Pro Tip: Don’t Just Commit — Celebrate

Every time you write `🏆 victory`, pause.  
Take a breath.  
You didn’t just push code.  
You upgraded a process.  
You made someone’s job easier.

That’s worth celebrating.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is not official, either standard.
This is **not meant for corporations that fear emojis**.

But if you're building something real — pain and emotions — it could be yours as well!!
